This is a comprehensive review of the wrong answers that I got on test 4. This review will include the answers, why they're correct
and what could have been the reason behind them being wrong.



Question 1: You are hosting a web server on an EC2 Instance. With the number of requests consuming a large part of the CPU, 
the response performance for the application is getting degraded. Which of the following would help to alleviate the problem 
and provide a better response time?

Answer: Place a CloudFront distribution in front of the EC2 Instance.
Answer I chose: Place the EC2 instance behind the App Load balancer.
Reasoning according to Whizlabs: "Since there is a mention of only one EC2 instance, placing it behind the ELB 
would not make much sense, hence Options A & B are invalid."
Having it an autoscaling group with just one instnace would not make much sense
Cloudfront distribution would help to alleviate the load in the EC2 instance because of its edge location and cache feature




Question 3: A company is hosting a MySQL database in AWS using the AWS RDS service. To offload the reads, a Read Replica has been created and 
reports are run off the Read Replica database. But at certain times, the reports show stale data. 
What could be the possible reason behind this?

Real Answer: This is due to the replicate lag.

Whizlabs Reasoning: An AWS Whitepaper on the caveat for reading replicas is given below which must be taken into consideration
by architects. Read Replicas are seperate database instance that are replicated asychronously. As a result, they are subject to
replication lag and might be missing sme of the latest transactions. Application architects need to consider which queries
 have the tolerance to slightly state data. These queries can be executed on a Read Replica, while the rest should run on the
 primary node. Read Replicas may also not accept any write queries.


Answer I chose: The backup of the original database has not been set properly.
 My Reasoning: I clearly didn't read this that well. The words "at certain times, the reports show stale data" was a pretty dead
 giveaway. I need to read more carefully. 

Question 6: A company has set up its data layer in the Simple Storage Service. There are a number of requests which include read/write and updates to objects in an S3 bucket. 
Users sometimes complain that updates to an object are not being reflected. What could be the most likely reason for this?

My Answer I chose: Versioniong is not enabled for the bucket, so the newer version does not reflect the right data.
Reasoning: I asssumed versioning was the answer. The reason being that I saw the word "update" ; since this is S3 
updating is part of what versioning does. 

Real Answer: Updates made to the object usually take sometime to reflect. 
Whizlabs Explanation: Updates made to the objects in S3 follow an eventaul consistency model. Hence, for object updates there can
be a slight delay when an updated object is provided back to the user on the next request.

Question 8: A company planning to move to the AWS Cloud wants to leverage its existing Chef recipes for configuration management of its infrastructure. 
Which AWS service would be ideal to fulfill this requirement?

Answer I chose: AWS Elastic Beanstalk
Reasoning: I didn't have enough knowledge about AWS Opworks to figure out that it was the right answer.

Actaul Answer: AWS OpsWorks is a configuration management service that helps you to configure and operate applications in a cloud 
in a cloud enterprise by using Puppet or Chef. AWS OpsWorks Stacks and AWS OpsWorks for Chef Automate let you use Chef cookbooks 
and solutions for configuration management, while AWS OpsWorks for Puupet Enterprise lets you configure a Puppet Enterprise master 
server in AWS Puppet offers a set of tools for enforcing the desired starte of your infrastructure and automating on-demand
tasks. 

Question 10: A company offers its customers short-lived contests that require users to upload files in hopes of winning prizes.
These contests can last up to two weeks, with unknown uploads and the resulting file analysis can last up to three months. 
The company currently stores four weeks of data in an S3 bucket and now it needs an economic and scalable object storage solution to hold it's customer files.
The files will be accessed once and then deleted. What would be the best solution for the company in this scenario?

My Answer: Amazon Standard S3
Reasoning:
