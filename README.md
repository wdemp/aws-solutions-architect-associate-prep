Bucket: a container (web folder) for objects (files) stored in Amazon S3.  They are are global names; meaning there can't be any duplicates with the same name. The containers can contain up to 63 lowercase letters. Each account can have up to 100 buckets per account.

AWS Regions: specific locations that work with S3 buckets. While the S3 buckets can be accessed globally, the S3 bucket can be stored and used in a specific region that you choose. This allows better access and control of your files. The files can be stored in a region that is particular to that region in order to satisfy customer requirements in order to reduce latency, or located in particular region to satisfy data locality and sovereignty concerns.
